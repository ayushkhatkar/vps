# vps
Quick script to install all the required tools over a VPS (tested on DEBIAN). It will install a Kali OS over the VPS and will install tools in a directory called "Tools". I run this script as "Root" and paths are hardcoded to "/root/Tools"
#install
```git clone the repo
```cd vps/ then 
```chomd +x tools.sh 
```./tool.sh
If you face any issues for installation, please reach out to me at Twitter @ayush0x01
